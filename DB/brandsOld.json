{"_id":{"$oid":"64e438a98a10ef8ad36d7017"},"id":180060,"name":"HYT","url":"https://www.hytwatches.com/","country":"Switzerland","description":"HYT is a Swiss luxury watch brand known for its innovative and unconventional timepieces. The name 'HYT' stands for 'Hydro Technology,' which refers to their unique approach of using fluids to indicate time.\nTraditional watches use mechanical movements or electronic displays to show the time, but HYT watches use a patented fluidic module to display hours using a liquid-filled capillary tube. This liquid moves gradually as time passes, allowing the user to read the time based on the position of the liquid within the tube. The minutes are typically displayed through a more conventional sub-dial.\nThe fluid used in HYT watches is specially formulated to be immune to temperature changes and is driven by a mechanical movement. This combination of fluid mechanics and watchmaking expertise results in a visually striking and mechanically complex timepiece.\nHYT watches are known for their avant-garde designs and limited-edition models. They appeal to watch enthusiasts who are interested in unconventional horological concepts and cutting-edge design. Keep in mind that my knowledge is based on information available up until September 2021, so there may have been developments or new releases in the HYT watch lineup since then.","class":["Luxury"],"location":{"en":"https://www.hytwatches.com/"}}

We wanted to create a range of luxurious watches that you'd be proud to gift your brother, father, son - or yourself!\nWe set out with a simple goal when starting this venture - that our timepieces should accentuate the values of our wearers and provide an uncompromising and distinguished look that doesn't break the bank.\nAs we've said before: we focus on quality over quantity. This is why we only produce our watches in small batches. Sure, we could save money on big production runs but we would lose the ability to have hands-on control throughout the entire process.
